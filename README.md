# Service And Transporting Interface

This project enables a company operating in the service and transportation industry to track its vehicles and customers. There are two types of users: administrator and user. The administarator system uses full capacity. The user is limited. This distinction is determined on the login screen. Access rights are regulated according to the determined qualifications. Thanks to this system, the administrator can monitor both the status of the users and the status of the customers. The users, on the other hand, adjust their customers' status through this system and provide convenience during the work.

## Getting Started

Download a copy of the project files to your local machine to run the project. After obtaining the required environments, you can open the project in this environment and run it and use the application through the window that opens after it is run. When trying to run a second time, simply run ~\ServiceAndTransporting \ServiceAndTransporting \bin \Debug \ServiceAndTransporting.exe in the location of the project.

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio 
- Microsoft SQL Server

To run the project, you must first obtain any version of the software suitable for your system from [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and install it on your local machine. As a next step, you will obtain a database from [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/tr-tr/sql-server/sql-server-2019) and save the data base files in this database. Then, it will be enough to introduce the project to IDE environment and perform the debug operation. During this process, you should test the connection between the database and the project and make the necessary adjustments.
